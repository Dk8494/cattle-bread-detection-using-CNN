🐄 Cattle Breed Detection Using Deep Learning 📌 Project Overview

Cattle Breed Detection Using Deep Learning is an AI-powered computer vision system designed to automatically identify cattle breeds from images. The project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on cattle images and is deployed as a Streamlit web application for real-time, user-friendly predictions.

This project is ideal for farmers, researchers, and smart agriculture solutions.

🐮 Supported Cattle Breeds

The system can accurately classify the following cattle breeds:

Ayrshire Cattle

Jersey Cattle

Holstein Friesian Cattle

Brown Swiss Cattle

Red Dane Cattle
